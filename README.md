# Malware-App-detection
Malware app detection using neural networks

Dataset Description
We have used the NATICUSdroid (Android Permissions) Dataset, taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/722/naticusdroid+android+permissions+dataset It contains permissions extracted from more than 29000 benign & malware Android apps released between 2010-2019. We have used neural networks to predict whether an app is benign (0) or malware (1), based on the permissions the app asks for.

Implemented batch gradient descent, forward propagation, cost computation, backpropagation, parameters upda-
tion.

Adittionally, used Tensorflow Keras to implement more neural network models.
Compared the performances of the following variations: Rmsprop. Adam with tanh activation function in hidden
layers, Adam with Leaky Relu activation function in hidden layers.
Achieved an accuracy of around 95% in the models.
